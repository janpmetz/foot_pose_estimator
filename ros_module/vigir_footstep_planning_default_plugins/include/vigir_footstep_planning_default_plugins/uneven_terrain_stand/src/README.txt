Qhull can be called as an external application, but the documentation tells that this is wasteful for multiple calls. Qhull has an experimental C++ interface that does not cover all functionality of Qhull, for example it only has a method runQhull but misses runQhull3D to construct 3 dimensional convex hulls. However the missing method can be added to the interface as described on stackoverflow (see below). This method has beed added to Qhull.h and Qhull.cpp.
